                                        <li>Custom Air Handling Units Daikin offers a full line of custom, fully variable geometry, air handling products. Available for both outdoor (900 to 65,000 CFM) and indoor (600 to 129,000 CFM) applications. Daikin offers such options as energy recovery, fan arrays, VFDs, factory installed controls, OSP listing and advanced filtration. The distinct advantage of the Daikin line of AHUs is that it brings many advantages of a custom configurable AHU but at a semi-custom AHU cost point.</li>
                                        <li>Daikin's cutting edge WMC and WME chillers feature oil-free, frictionless magnetic bearing compressors. Instead of traditional bearings, these chillers use a magnetic field to levitate the compressor impeller shaft, eliminating any friction and the need for any lubricating oil. This results in incredibly high efficiencies with IPLVs as low as 0.26 and industry leading low sound levels. Sizes range from 100 to 1,500 tons and come in single and dual compressor configurations.</li>
                                        <li>For larger applications Daikin offers a water cooled centrifugal chiller in size ranges from 200 to 2,700 tons. The single compressor WSC (200 - 1,250 tons) has one of the smallest footprints per ton, perfect for retrofit applications and to optimize mechanical room space. The dual compressor chiller comes in a single circuit WDC (400 - 2500 tons) for superior part load efficiencies or dual circuit WCC (1,200 - 2,700 tons) for exceptional full load efficiency. All Daikin centrifugal chillers have options for supplied VFDs for increased part load performance.</li>
                                        <li>For smaller tonnage applications, Daikin offers both a scroll and screw compressor in a water cooled chillers. The scroll compressor WGZ ranges from 30 to 200 tons, while the screw compressor WGS ranges from 130 to 190 tons. Efficiencies range from up to 16 EER at full load and to up to 21 IPLV. Designed for easy retrofit, many models fit through standard three-foot doors.</li>
                                        <li>Air cooled chillers are a packaged system that produces chilled water by rejecting heat though an integral air cooled condenser coil, eliminated the need for a cooling tower and water treatment. Daikin offers a line of air-cooled chillers in both screw and scroll compressor varieties. Sizes range from 10 up to 550 tons and can have EER values as high as 19+ IPLV. VFD, low sound options, remote evaporator and pump packages are available on certain models.</li>
                                        <li>Daikin offers a full range of gas/electric and heat pump rooftop equipment ranging from 3 - 140 tons for constant volume and VAV applications. For high efficiency requirements, some options that are available include VFDs, inverter driven compressors, and evaporative condensing. Also some units feature the Daikin Intelligent Equipment (IE) System, that allows monitoring, data collection and control of the unit though a cloud-based server without the need for a BMS.</li>
                                        <li>Daikin offers vertical and horizontal fan coils ranging from 200-3,000 CFM. Their compact and lightweight design makes them a good fit for many 2 and 4-pipe systems. AHRI certified and offered in belt or direct drive in several cabinet sizes and configurations. Daikin also has the option to provice hard piped factory installed valve packages on their fan coils.</li>
                                        <li>Variable Refrigerant Volume, or VRV, is a modular refrigeration system that allows for simultaneous heating and cooling through multiple fan coils run from a single bank of condensing units. It offers many of the benefits of WSHPs and 4-pipe central plants but at a lower cost point and simpler installation. Daikin, the largest HVAC manufacturer in the world, has recently released VRV IV, the most versatile, expansive and efficient VRV system in the market.</li>
                                        <li>Daikin has a wide range of vertical and horizontal WSHPs from 1/2 ton up to 25 tons in both standard-efficiency Enfinity and high-efficiency SmartSource product lines. Daikin also has vertical stack, curb mounted rooftops, and water-to-water water source heat pumps in their product lineup as well as a variety of options from multispeed compressors, electronically commutated motors (ECM), geothermal range units, and sound attenuating packages.</li>

                                        <li>Chilled beams are an excellent way to downsize your air delivery system for spaces with high sensible and low latent loads. Active chilled beams use a primary airstream to induce room air across cold and hot water coils to condition the space and get the necessary air change rate, whereas passive beams use convection for air movement. By utilizing water as a thermal transfer fluid, chilled beams are more efficient than a standard mixed air system and are an excellent solution for hospitals and other applications that do not allow recirculated air. </li>
                                        <li>Underfloor air delivers conditioned air from below the floor level as opposed to a traditional overhead ceiling approach. In a fully mixing system, underfloor air is specifically designed to condition and mix only the occupied zone. As such, underfloor air distribution is capable of managing higher loads and can offer savings over a traditional overhead mixing system. Additionally, it is a great solution for dynamic and frequently changing zone spaces.</li>
                                        <li>Displacement ventilation involves delivering conditioned air at a low velocity and higher temperature to the occupied zone with minimal induction and mixing. Heat loads are conditioned through heat plumes and extracted at the ceiling. Some advantages of displacement ventilation include significant energy savings, improved thermal comfort and indoor air quality.</li>
                                        <li>Price has an extensive offering of terminal boxes for VAV and CAV applications.

                                        <li>Venturi valves are valves that have the ability to control airflow independent of duct static pressure. This eliminates the need for separate flow stations and dampers and can compensate for fluctuating duct pressure. Triatek manufactures an industry leading Venturi valve that can be made to universally accept multiple third party controllers. Additionally, they have universal controllers that can be retrofitted to existing equipment; perfect for renovations and energy saving upgrades.</li>

                                        <li>Chilled beams are an excellent way to downsize your air delivery system for spaces with high sensible and low latent loads. Active chilled beams use a primary airstream to induce room air across cold and hot water coils to condition the space and satisfy the necessary air change rate, whereas passive beams use convection for air movement. By utilizing water as a thermal transfer fluid, chilled beams are more efficient than a standard all mixed air system and are an excellent solution for hospitals and other applications that do not allow recirculated air.</li>
                                        <li>Underfloor air delivers conditioned air from below the floor level as opposed to a traditional overhead ceiling approach. In a fully mixing system, underfloor air is specifically designed to condition and mix only the occupied zone. As such, underfloor air distribution is capable of managing higher loads and can offer savings over a traditional overhead mixing system. Additionally it is a great solution for dynamic and frequently changing zone spaces.</li>
                                        <li>Displacement ventilation involves delivering conditioned air at  lower velocities and higher temperatures to the occupied zone with minimal induction and mixing. Heat loads are conditioned through heat plumes and extracted at the ceiling. Some advantages of displacement ventilation include significant energy savings and improved thermal comfort and indoor air quality. Trox also offers a unique concentric circle design floor diffuser that appeals to interior designers, architects and building owners.</li>

                                        <li>Radiant panels utilize thermal radiation in order to provide sensible cooling and heating to the space, while relying on a separate air system to provide ventilation and latent loads.
